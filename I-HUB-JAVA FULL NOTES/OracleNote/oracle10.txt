2) Multiple row sub query
=========================
If sub query returns more then one row is called multiple row sub query.

To perform multiple row sub query we need to use multiple row operators.

We have three multiple row operators.

i) ANY 

ii) ALL

iii) IN 

i) ANY 
-------
	select * from emp where esal > ANY (select esal from emp where deptno=10);

	select * from emp where esal < ANY (select esal from emp where deptno=10);



2) ALL
-----
	select * from emp where esal > ALL (select esal from emp where deptno=10);

	select * from emp where esal < ALL (select esal from emp where deptno=20);


3) IN 
------
	select * from emp where esal IN (select esal from emp where deptno=10);



3) Multiple column sub query
============================
If a sub query returns more then one column is called multiple column sub query.

In multiple column sub query we need to use IN operator.

ex:
---
	select * from emp where(eid,ename,esal) IN (select eid,ename,esal from emp where eid=201);

	select eid,ename,esal from emp where(eid,ename,esal) IN (select eid,ename,esal from emp
								where eid=201);


	select eid,ename,esal from emp where(eid,ename,esal) IN (select eid,ename,esal from emp
								where deptno=10);


Q) What is the difference between RDBMS and MongoDB?

RDBMS						MongoDB
------						-------
It is a relational database.			It is a non-relational or document based database

It can't store the data in key and value pair.	It can stores the data in key and value pair.

Not suitable for hierarchical data storage.	Suitable for hierarchical data storage.

It has a static schema.				It has a dynamic schema.

It contains tables.				It contains collections.

It is row based.				It is document based.

It is column based.				It is field based.

It is slower.					It is faster.

It supports SQL query language.			It supports JSON query language.

PL/SQL
======
PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extension to Structured Query Language.

PL/SQL is a extension of SQL and contains following features.

1) We can achieve programming features like control statements, loops and etc.

2) It reduces network traffic.

3) We can display custom error messages by using the concept of exception handling.

4) We can perform related operations by using the concept of triggers.

5) It saves the source code permanent to database for repeated execution.

PL/SQL block
============
A PL/SQL program is also known as PL/SQL block.

syntax:
-------
	DECLARE 
	-
	-	-- Declaration section 
	-
	BEGIN
	-
	-	-- Executable section 
	-
	EXCEPTION
	-
	-	-- Exception section 	
	-
	END;
	/

Declaration section 
-------------------
Declaration section is used to declare variables, cursors, exceptions and etc.

It is optional section.


Executable section
-------------------
Execution section contains actual code of a program.

It is mandatory section.


EXCEPTION section
------------------
It contains lines of code which is executed when exception is raised.

It is optional section.



To see the output in PL/SQL we need on server output environment.

ex:
	SQL> set   serveroutput   on 



Q) Write a PL/SQL program to display Hello World?

	BEGIN
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello World');
	END;
	/

	Here DBMS_OUTPUT is a package name.
	Here PUT_LINE is a procedure name.
	Here '/' is used to submit the PL/SQL program into database.

Q) Write a PL/SQL program to perform sum of two numbers?

	DECLARE 
	A number;
	B number;
	C number;
	BEGIN
	A:=10;
	B:=20;
	C:=A+B;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(C);
	END;
	/


Declaration and Initialization using single line
------------------------------------------------

	DECLARE 
	A number:=10;
	B number:=20;
	C number:=A+B;
	BEGIN
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(C);
	END;
	/


To read dynamic values we need to use '&' symbol.

ex:
---
	DECLARE 
	A number(3);
	B number(3);
	C number(6);
	BEGIN
	A:=&a;
	B:=&b;
	C:=A+B;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Sum of two numbers is ='||C);
	END;
	/

Using PL/SQL we can perform DML operations.


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to insert a record into student table?

	DECLARE 
	L_sno  number(3);
	L_sname varchar2(10);
	L_sadd  varchar2(12);
	BEGIN
	L_sno:=&sno;
	L_sname:='&sname';
	L_sadd:='&sadd';
	insert into student values(L_sno,L_sname,L_sadd);
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Please check the table');
	END;
	/ 
	
	
Q) Write a PL/SQL program to update student name based on student number?


	DECLARE 
	L_sname varchar2(10);
	L_sno number(3);
	BEGIN
	L_sname:='&sname';
	L_sno:=&sno;
	update student set sname=L_sname where sno=L_sno;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Please check the table');
	END;
	/
