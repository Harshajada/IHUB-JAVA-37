TCL Commands
=============
We have three TCL commands.

1) commit

2) rollback 

3) savepoint 


1) commit
----------
	It is used to make the changes permanent to database.
	ex:
		drop table student;

		create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
		insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
		insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

		commit;

		select * from student; // 2 records 

2) rollback
-----------
	It is used to undo the changes which are not permanent.

	ex:
		drop table student;

		create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
		
		insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
		insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

		commit;

		insert into student values(103,'ramana','vizag');
		insert into student values(104,'raju','pune');

		select * from student; // 4 records 	

		rollback;

		select * from student; // 2 records 


3) savepoint 
-------------
	It is used to mark logical transaction in a database.
	
	Instead of complete rollback we can rollback upto savepoint.

	syntax:
		savepoint <savepoint_name>;

	ex:
		drop table student;

		create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
		
		insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
		insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

		savepoint sp1;

		insert into student values(103,'ramana','vizag');
		insert into student values(104,'raju','pune');

		savepoint sp2;

		insert into student values(105,'Alan','Texas');
		insert into student values(106,'Nelson','Miami');

		select * from student; // 6 records 			


		rollback to sp2;

		select * from student; // 4 records 

DCL commands
============
We have two types of DCL commands.

1) grant 

2) revoke 

Schema 
-------
	Schema is a memory location which is used to run SQL commands.

Privileges
---------
	Permission given to a user is called privileges.
	
	In short, rights given to a user is called privileges.
	
	We have two types of privileges.

	1) System privilege 
	-------------------
		Permission given by DBA to user.

	2) Object privilege 
	-------------------
		Permission given by one user to another user.


1) grant 
--------
It is used grant the permissions.

syntax:
	grant <privilege1>,<privilege2> to <user_name>;


2) revoke
-----------
It is used to revoke the permissions.

syntax:
-----
	revoke <privilege1>,Privilege2> from <user_name>;

DBA> create user sai identified by sai;

DBA> create user ramya identified by ramya;

SAI>  conn sai/sai   -- logon denied

RAMYA> conn ramya/ramya --logon denied

DBA> grant connect,resource to sai,ramya;

SAI>  conn sai/sai   -- connected

RAMYA> conn ramya/ramya -- connected 

SAI> 

create table employee(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10));
insert into employee values(101,'Alan',1000);
insert into employee values(102,'Jose',2000);
insert into employee values(103,'Mark',3000);
commit;
select * from employee;


RAMYA> select * from sai.employee; -- table or view does not exist

SAI> grant select on employee to ramya;

RAMYA> select * from sai.employee;

RAMYA> delete from sai.employee; --insufficient privileges

SAI> grant delete on employee to ramya;

RAMYA> delete from sai.employee;
RAMYA> commit;

RAMYA> select * from sai.employee;// no rows selected

SAI> select * from employee;

SAI> revoke select,delete on employee from ramya;

RAMYA> disc 

SAI> disc 

DBA> revoke connect,resource from sai,ramya;

RAMYA> conn ramya/ramya  --logon denied

SAI> conn sai/sai   -- logon denied


Sequence
=========
Sequence is an object which is used to generate the numbers.

syntax:
	create sequence <sequence_name> start with value increment by value;

ex:
	create sequence sq1 start with 1 increment by 1;

	create sequence sq1 start with 101 increment by 1;

	create sequence sq1 start with 10 increment by 10;

We have two pseudo's of a sequence.

1) NEXTVAL
---------
	It is used to generate next number in a sequence.
	
	ex:
		create sequence sq1 start with 101 increment by 1;
	
		drop table student;
	
		create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

		insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'raja','hyd');	
		insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'ravi','delhi');	
		insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'ramana','vizag');	

		commit;	

2) CURRVAL 
-----------
	It returns the last number generated by the sequence.
	ex:
		select sq1.currval from dual;		


Interview Queries
----------------

Q) Write a query to see the list of sequences present in database?

	select sequence_name from user_sequences;


Q) Write a query to drop the sequence?

	drop sequence sq1;


Q) Write a query to the list of users present in database?

	select username from all_users;


Q) Write a query to drop the user from database?

	drop user sai CASCADE;
	drop user ramya cascade;


Assignment
==========
Q) Write a query to display last three records from employee?
