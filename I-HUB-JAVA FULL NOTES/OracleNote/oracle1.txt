Types of data
=============
We have two types of data.

1) Unstructured data 

2) Structured data 

1) Unstructured data 
--------------------
Data which is not in readable format is called unstructured data.

In general, meaningless data is called unstructured data.

ex:
	201    Lakemba      SYD     NSW    AUS 


2) Structured data 
------------------
Data which is in readable format is called structured data.

In general, meaningfull data is called structured data.

ex:
	Unit   Locality     City    State  Country
        -----  --------     ----    -----  --------
	201    Lakemba      SYD     NSW    AUS 


Oracle
======
It is one of the database which is used to store structured data.

It is a RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) database.

It is a product of Oracle Corporation.

It is classified into two types.

				Oracle 
				|
	-------------------------------------------------
	|						|
	SQL						PL/SQL 
(Structured Query Language)			(Procedural / Structured Query Language)


Management System
=================
It is a software which is used to manage the database.

Using management system we can perform following acitivities very easily.

1) Adding the new data 

2) Updating the existing data

3) Deleting the unnecessary data 

4) Selecting the required data 



Q) What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS ?

DBMS						RDBMS
-------						-------
It stands for Database Management System.	It stands for Relational Database Management System.

It stores the data in files.			It stores the data in tables.

It is not designed to store large amount of 	It is designed to store large amount of data.
data.

It provides support for one user at a time.	It provides support for multiple users at a time.

It does not support normalization.		It supports normalization.
						(It will remove data redundency)

There is no data security.			There is a high data security.	



Client-Server Architecture
==========================
In this architecture we will see how our frontend data will store in a backend.

Diagram: oracle1.1

Frontend
---------
The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.
ex:
	Java, .Net, Python, Perl , Kotlin and etc.

Communication Channel
--------------------
It acts like a bridge between frontend and backend.
ex:
	JDBC - Java Database Connectivity
	ODBC - Open Database Connectivity 
	PDBC - Python Database Connectivity 

BackEnd
-------
The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs operations based on the instructions given by frontend is called backend.
ex:
	Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, NoSQL, PostegeSQL, Teradata, Sybase, DB2 and etc.


SQL
====
SQL stands for Structured Query Language which is pronounce as SEQUEL.

This language is used to interact with oracle database software.

It is a case insensitive language.

It is a command based language.

Every command must starts with verb.
ex:
	insert, update, delete, merge and etc.

Every command must ends with semicolon.

It is developed in late 1972 by Mr.Codd (By IBM). 


Sub languages of SQL
=====================
We have five sub languages of SQL.

1) DDL (Data Definition Language)

2) DML (Data Manipulation Language)

3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)

4) TCL  (Transaction Control Language)

5) DCL (Data Control Language)


1) DDL (Data Definition Language)
---------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the objects in database.

It is a collection of five commands.

ex:
	create, alter, drop , truncate and rename.


2) DML (Data Manipulation Language)
-------------------------------------
This language is used to manipulate the data present in database.

It is a collection of four commands.

ex:
	insert, update, delete and merge.


3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)
---------------------------------------
This language is used to retrieve the data from database.

It is a collection of one command.

ex:
	select 


4) TCL  (Transaction Control Language)
-----------------------------
This language is used to maintain the transaction of database.

It is a collection of three commands.

ex:
	commit, rollback and savepoint.


5) DCL (Data Control Language)
----------------------------
This language is used to control the access of data to the user.

It is a collection of two commands.

ex:
	grant and revoke 


Table
======
A Table is an object which is used to represent the data.

A table is a collection of rows and columns.

Oracle is a case insensitive. But data which is present in a table is a case sensitive.

ex:
		SNO		SNAME		SADD
		---------------------------------------
		101	|	Alan	|	Florida	
		---------------------------------------
		102	|	Jose	|	Texas
		---------------------------------------
		103	|	Nelson	|	Miami
		---------------------------------------
		Here we have 3 rows and 3 columns.
