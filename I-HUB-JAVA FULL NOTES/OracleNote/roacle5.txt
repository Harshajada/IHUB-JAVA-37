drop table emp1;

create table emp1(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),edoj date);

insert into emp1 values(201,'Alan','01-JAN-24');

insert into emp1 values(202,'Jose',sysdate);

insert into emp1 values(203,'Mark',current_date);

commit;



iii) Date functions
====================

ADD_MONTHS()

	ex:
		select LAST_DAY(sysdate) from dual;

		select LAST_DAY('25-SEP-24') from dual;

iv) Conversion functions
========================
Conversion function is used to convert from datatype to another datatype.
ex:
	TO_CHAR() 

We have two pseudo for TO_CHAR() function.

a) number to_char()
-------------------
	It supports '9' in digits, dollar and euros symbol.
	ex:
		select eid,ename,esal from emp;
	
		select eid,ename,TO_CHAR(esal,'9,999') from emp;
		
		select eid,ename,TO_CHAR(esal,'99,999') from emp;

		select eid,ename,TO_CHAR(esal,'$99,999') from emp;

		select eid,ename,TO_CHAR(esal,'$99,999') as ESAL from emp;	
	

b) date to_char() 
----------------
	ex:
		select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'dd-MM-yyyy') from dual;

		select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'yyyy-MM-dd') from dual;

		select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'year') from dual;

		select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'month') from dual;
		
		select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'day') from dual;

		select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'yyyy') from dual;

		select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'MM') from dual;
		
		select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'dd') from dual;

		select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'HH:MI:SS') from dual;

		select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'dd-MM-yyyy HH:MI:SS') from dual;



Interview queries
-----------------

Q) Write a query to display employee information from employee table?

	select eid as id,
		upper(ename) as ename,
			TO_CHAR(esal,'$99,999') as esal,
				deptno,
				  lower(job) as job,
					comm
			  			from emp;

userlist table
==============
drop table userlist;

create table userlist(uname varchar2(10),pwd varchar2(10));

insert into userlist values('raja','rani');

insert into userlist values('king','kingdom');

commit;


Q) Write a query to check username and password is valid or not?

	select count(*) from userlist where uname='raja' and pwd='rani';// 1 

	select count(*) from userlist where uname='raja' and pwd='rani2'; // 0 


Group by clause
===============
Group by clause is used to divided the rows into multiple groups so that we can apply group functions.

A column which we used in group by clause , same column name we need too use in select clause.

ex:

Q) Write a query to display sum of salary of each department?

	select sum(esal),deptno from emp group by deptno;


Q) Write a query to display minimum salary of each job?

	select min(esal),job from emp group by job;


Q) WRite a query to display highest salary of each department?

	select max(esal),deptno from emp group by deptno;


Q) Write a query to display average salary of each job?

	select avg(esal),job from emp group by job;



Having clause
==============
Having clause is used to filter the rows in group by clause.

Having clause must place after group by clause.


Q) Write a query to display sum of salary of each department whose sum of salary is greater 
then 30000?

	select sum(esal),deptno from emp group by deptno having sum(esal)>30000;



Q) Write a query to display minimum salary of each job where minimum salary is greater then equals to 10000?

	select min(esal),job from emp group by job having min(esal)>=10000;



Order by clause
===============
Order by clause is used to arrange the rows in a table.

By default it will arrange in ascending order.

ex:
	select * from emp order by eid;	

	select * from emp order by eid desc;	

	select * from emp order by ename;

	select * from emp order by ename desc;



Q) Write a query to display minimum salary of each job where minimum salary is greater then equals to 10000?

	select min(esal),deptno from emp group by deptno having min(esal)>=10000 order by deptno;


	select min(esal),deptno from emp group by deptno having min(esal)>=10000 order by deptno desc;


Integrity Constraints
=====================
Constraints are the rules which are applied on the tables.

Using constraints we can achieve accuracy and quality of data.

We have following list of constraints in SQL.

1) NOT NULL 

2) UNIQUE 

3) PRIMARY KEY 

4) FOREIGN KEY 

5) CHECK 

Constraints are created at two levels.

i) column level 

ii) table level
