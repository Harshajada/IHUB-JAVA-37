Views
======
It is a virtual representation of a data from one or more then one table.

A table which is used to create a view is called base table or above table.

syntax:
------
	create view <view_name> as select stmt;

ex:
	create view v1 as select * from emp;

View does not consumes the memory.

View does not have data.

View will get the data from base table when we execute select command.

We have following list of views.

1) Simple view 

2) Complex view 

3) With read only view 

4) With check option view 

5) Materialized view


1) Simple view 
-----------
If a view is created by using one base table is called simple view.

DML operations are allowed in simple view.

ex:
	create view v1 as select * from student;

	select  * from v1; // 3 records 

	delete from v1; // 3 records deleted 

	select * from student; // no rows selected
	


2) Complex view 
---------------
If a view is created by using more then one base table is called complex view.

In complex view DML operations are not allowed.

ex:
	create view v2 as select e.eid,e.ename,e.esal,d.dname,d.dloc from emp e,dept d
			where (e.deptno=d.deptno);


	select * from v2;

	delete from v2; //cannot delete from view



3) With read only view 
----------------------
If we create a view by using one base table and DML operation are not allowed then we need to use with read only view.

ex:
	create view v3 as select * from emp with read only;

	select * from v3;

	delete from v3; //cannot delete from view



4) With check option view 
-----------------------
If we create a view by using one base table and DML operations are allowed only when condition is true then we need to use with check option view.

ex:
	create view v4 as select * from emp where deptno=30 with check option;

	select * from v4;

	insert into v4 values(209,'Julie',26000,70,'Salesman',500); // view WITH CHECK OPTION

	insert into v4 values(209,'Julie',26000,30,'Salesman',500);  //inserted


5) Materialized view
---------------------
To create a materialized view a table must have primary key.

ex:
	alter table emp add primary key(eid);

	create materialized view v5 as select * from emp;

	select * from v5; // 9 records 

	select * from emp; // 9 records 

	delete from emp where eid IN (208,209); // 2 records deleted

	select * from v5; // 9 records 

	select * from emp; // 7 records 
	
To get updated data from base table we need to refresh the view.

ex:
	exec  DBMS_SNAPSHOT.REFRESH('v5');

	DBMS_SNAPSHOT is a package name 
	REFRESH is a procedure name

	select * from v5; // 7 records 

	select * from emp; // 7 records 


Q) Write a query to see the list of views present in database?

	select view_name from user_views;


Q) Write a query to drop the view.
	
	drop view v1;
	drop view v2;
	drop view v3;
	drop view v4;	
	drop materialized view v5;


Merge command
=============
Merge command is a combination of insert and update command.

student10 table
----------------
drop table student10;

create table student10(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

insert into student10 values(101,'raja','hyd');

insert into student10 values(102,'ravi','delhi');

insert into student10 values(103,'ramana','vizag');

commit;

student20 table
--------------
drop table student20;

create table student20(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

insert into student20 values(103,'Alan','Texas');

insert into student20 values(104,'Nelson','Vegas');

commit;


	merge into student10 s1 
	using student20 s2
	ON(s1.sno=s2.sno)
	when matched then 
	update set sname=s2.sname,sadd=s2.sadd
	when not matched then 
	insert (sno,sname,sadd) values(s2.sno,s2.sname,s2.sadd);

	select * from student10; // 2 rows merged
		
	select * from student20;


Sub Queries
============
If we declare a query inside another query such concept is called sub query.

In sub queries , first inner query will execute then outer/parent query.

Sub queries are used to select the records based on unknown values.

we have following list of sub queries.

1) Single Row Sub query 

2) Multiple Row Sub query 

3) Multiple Column Sub query 


1) Single Row Sub query 
-------------------------
If a sub query returns only one row is called single row sub query.

Sub query can be nested upto 32 levels.

ex:
	SQL Query 
	---------
		select * from emp where eid=201;
		
	Sub Query 
	---------
		select * from emp where eid=(select eid from emp where ename='Alan');

ex:
---
	SQL Query
	--------
		select * from emp where eid=201	and ename='Alan';

	Sub Query 
	--------
		select * from emp where 
		eid=(select eid from emp where esal=9000)
		and 
		ename=(select ename from emp where eid=201);



Q) Write a query to display employees information whose salary is greater then Mark salary?

		
	select * from emp where esal>(select esal from emp where ename='Mark');



Q) Write a query to display second highest salary from emp table?

	select max(esal) from emp where esal<(select max(esal) from emp);
