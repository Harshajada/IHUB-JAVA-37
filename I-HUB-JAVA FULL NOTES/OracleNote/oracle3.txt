Q)Write a java program to read a string and find out sum of all digits in the string and check even number or odd number?

Example:

input:
	NEX123

output:
	No of digits in the given string = 3
	Sum of all digits in the given string = 6
	Sum is even number

ex:
---
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		String str="NEX123";
		
		String substr=str.replaceAll("[^0-9]","");  // 123
		
		int count=0,sum=0;
		
		for(int i=0;i<substr.length();i++)
		{
			int n=Character.getNumericValue(substr.charAt(i));
			{
				sum+=n;
				count++;
			}
			
		}
		System.out.println("No of digits in the given string ="+count);
		System.out.println("Sum of all digits in the given string ="+sum);
		if(sum%2==0)
			System.out.println("Sum is even number");
		else
			System.out.println("Sum is odd number");
		
	}
}

update command
===============
It is used to update the records in a database table.

syntax:
-------
	update <table_name> set <col_name>=<value> where condition;

ex:
----
	update student set sname='rani' where sno=101;

	update student set sname='gogo',sadd='AP' where sno=102;

	update student set sadd=null where sname='raj';

	commit;


Note:
-----
If we are not using where clause then all rows will be updated.

ex:
	update student set sname='raja';



Delete command
===============
It is used to delete the records from database table.

syntax:
------
	delete from <table_name> where condition;

ex:
	delete from student where sno=105;

	delete from student where sname='ravi';

	delete from student where sadd='hyd';

	commit;

Note:
----
If we won't use where clause then all rows will be deleted.
ex:
	delete from student;
	delete from emp;
	delete from dept; 


	
Interview Queries 
-----------------

Q) Write a query to increment salary by 1000 whose employee id is 201?

	update emp set esal=esal+1000 where eid=201;



Q) Write a query to change the address of a student from hyd to MP?

	update student set sadd='MP' where sadd='hyd';



Q) Write a query to terminate the employee whose employee id is 205?

	delete from emp where eid=205;


Q) Write a query to terminate all the employees whose salary is greater then 25000?

	delete from emp where esal>25000;


Q) Write a query to delete all students whose address is null?

	delete from student where sadd is null;

Logical Operators 
=================
To declare multiple conditions is where clause we need to use logical operators.

We have three types of logical operators.

1) AND 

2) OR 

3) NOT 

1) AND 
------
It will return the records if all conditions are true.

In logical AND operator , all conditions must be from same row.

ex:
---
	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Alan'; //  record 

	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Jose'; // no rows selected 

	select * from emp where eid=209 AND ename='Alan'; // no rows selected 

	select * from emp where eid=208 AND ename='gogo'; // no rows selected 	 

2) OR 
------
It will return the records only if one condition is true.

In logical OR operator, conditions can be from any row.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Alan'; // 1 record 

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Jose'; // 2 records 

	select * from emp where eid=209 OR ename='Alan'; // 1 record 

	select * from emp where eid=208 OR ename='gogo'; //  no rows selected 


3) NOT 
-------
It will return the records except the condition.

A '<>' symbol denoted as logical NOT operator.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201;

	select * from emp where NOT eid=201;

	select * from emp where  eid<>201;


	select * from emp where NOT ename='Nancy';
	select * from emp where ename<>'Nancy';


Between operator
===============
It will return the records those who are in the range of values.

Between operator takes the support of AND operator.

In between operator we need to take lower limit then higher limit.

ex:
---
	select * from emp where eid between 201 AND 206;

	select * from emp where eid between 206 AND 201; // no rows selected 

	select * from emp where deptno between 10 AND 30;	



IN operator
============
IN operator is a replacement of OR operator.

It will return the records those who are matching in the list of values.

ex:
---
	select * from emp where eid IN (201,202,209);

	select * from emp where ename IN ('Alan','Jose','Lara');


Interview Queries
================

Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee id is 202 and employee name is 
    Jose?

	select * from emp where eid=202 AND ename='Jose';



Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee salary is greater then 15000 AND less then 40000?

	select * from emp where esal>15000 and esal<40000;

	

Q) Write a query to display employees information whose employee id is 201,202 and 203 ? 

	select * from emp where eid IN (201,202,203);


	
Q) Write a query to display employees information those who are not working in 10 department?

	select * from emp where deptno<>10;

Q) Write a query to delete the records whose employee name is Alan, Jose and Kelvin?

	delete from emp where ename IN ('Alan','Jose','Kelvin');
