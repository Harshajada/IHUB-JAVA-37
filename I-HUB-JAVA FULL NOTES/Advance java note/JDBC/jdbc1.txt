JDBC
======
As if now it is known as trademark.

But earlier it is called Java Database Connectivity.

RAM is a temperory storage device or medium.

During the program execution our data will store inside RAM.

Once the program execution is completed we will loss the data.

To overcome this limitation , we are making our applications writing the data in a file or database software.

Files and database softwares act like a permanent storage or medium.

Persistence
============
The process of storing and managing the data for a long period of time is called persistence.


Persistence Terminologies
==========================
1) Persistence store 
--------------------
	It is a place where we can store and manage the data for a long period of time.
	ex:
		Files 
		Database softwares.

2) Persistence data 
------------------
	A data of a persistence store is called persistence data.
	ex:
		Records 
		Tables


3) Persistence operation
-------------------------
	Insert, Update , Delete, Create, Select and etc are called persistence operations.
	In the realtime this operation is also known as CURD operation, CRUD operation or 
	SCUD operation.
	ex:
		C - create		S - select   
		U - update 		C - create 
		R - read		U - update 
		D - delete 		D - delete 


4) Persistence logic
----------------------
	A logic which is capable to perform persistence operations is called persistence logic.
	ex:
		IOStream
		JDBC Code 
		Hibernate Code 
		 
5) Persistence technology 
------------------------
	A technology which is used to develop persistence logics is called persistence technology.
	ex:
		JDBC
		Hibernate
		and etc.


Q) What is JDBC?

JDBC is a persistence technology which is used to develop persistence logics having the capability to perform persistence operations on persistence data of a persistence store.


Note:
-----
					   IOStream 
		JavaApp	---------------------------------------------- Files 
			   	Serialization/Deserialization


					   JDBC Code	
		JavaApp	---------------------------------------------- Database s/w 


Serialization
=============
	The process of storing object data into a file is called serialization.

	The process of converting object state to file state is called serialization.

	Diagram: jdbc1.1

Deserialization
===============
	The process of taking the data from file and representing an object is called deserialization.
	
	The process of converting file state to object state is called deserialization.

	Diagram: jdbc1.2		


Limitations with files as a persistence store
==============================================
> It stores limited amount of data.

> There is no security.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is not possible.

> It does not show an application with relationships.

> It does not allow us to apply contraints.

> Updation and Deletion of data can't be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can't be done easily.



Advantages of database as a persistence store
=============================================
> It stores unlimited amount of data.

> There is a security.

> Fetching the data with multiple condition is possible.

> It shows an application with relationships.

> It allows us to apply constraints.

> Updation and Deletion of data can be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can be done easily.



Every JDBC Application is a two tier application where java with JDBC code act like a frontend/tier1/Layer1 and database software acts like a backend/tier2/layer2.

Enduser is a non-technical person. He can't prepare and execute SQL query in a database software.He depends upon frontend developers having the capability to do that work for him.

JDBC Driver
===========
It acts like a bridge between java application and database software.

It is used to convert java instructions to database instructions and vice versa.

Diagram: jdbc1.4


ODBC Driver 
============
VBScript, D2K, Perl and etc uses ODBC driver to interact with database software.

Diagram: jdbc1.5


ODBC drivers developed in C language by taking the support pointers. Java does not support pointers.
To overcome this limitation Sun Micro System introduced JDBC Driver exclusively.

Q) Types of drivers in JDBC?

We have four types of JDBC drivers.

1) Type1 JDBC Driver / JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver 

2) Type2 JDBC Driver / Native API Driver 

3) Type3 JDBC Driver / Net Protocol Driver 

4) Type4 JDBC Driver / Native Protocols Driver 


Q) What is JDBC?

JDBC is a open technology given by Sun Micro System having set of rules and guidelines to develop JDBC drivers to interact with multiple database softwares.


Q) What is ODBC?

ODBC is a open technology given by Xopen company having set of rules and guidelines to develop ODBC
drivers to interact with multiple database softwares.


To use any JDBC Driver we need to register with DriverManager service.

Every JDBC application contains one built-in service called DriverManager service.


Class.forName()
===============
It is always recommanded to register JDBC driver with DriverManager service.

It is used to load driver class but it won't create an object.

ex:
	Class.forName("Driver-Class-Name");


Connection object
==================
Connection is an interface which is present in java.sql package.

It is an object of underlying supplied java class which implements java.sql.Connection interface.

To perform any operation in a database we have to establish the connection.

Once work with database is completed we have to close the connection.

ex:
	Connection con;


DriverManager.getConnection()
=============================
DriverManager is a class which is present in java.sql package.

A getConnection() method is used to interact with database software and returns one JDBC Connection object represent connectivity between java application and database software.

ex:
	Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("url");


Statement object
==================
Statement is an interface which is present in java.sql package.

It an object of underlying supplied java class which implements java.sql.Statement interface.

It acts like a vehicle between java application and database software.

It is used to sends and executes SQL query in database software.

ex:
	Statement st=con.createStatement();


ResultSet object
================
ResultSet is an interface which is present in java.sql package.

It contains two positions.

1) BFR (Before First Record/Row)

2) ALR (After Last Record/Row)

By default record pointer points to BFR position only.

rs.next()
=========
It is used to move to next position from current position. 

If next position is a record then it will return true.

If next position is ALR then it will return false.

Every record ResultSet having 1 as base index and every column of record ResultSet having 1 as base index.

In order to read the data from record ResultSet we need to use rs.getXxx() methods with index numbers or column names.

Here rs.getXxx() method means i.e rs.getInt(), rs.getString(), rs.getFloat(), rs.getDouble() and etc.

Diagram: jdbc1.6


Types of queries in JDBC
=========================
According to JDBC point of view we have two types of queries.

1) Select Queries

2) Non-Select Queries

1) Select Queries
--------------
Select queries give bunch of records from database software.
ex:
	select * from student;

A JDBC Statement object gave executeQuery() method to execute select queries.
ex:
	ResultSet rs=st.executeQuery("select * from student");



2) Non-Select Queries
-----------------------
Non-select queries give numeric value representing number of records effected in a database table.
ex:
	delete from student; // 3 

A JDBC Statement object gave executeUpdate() method to execute non-select queries.

ex:
	int result=st.executeUpdate("delete from student");


Type4 JDBC Driver / Native Protocol 
===================================

Driver class :		oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
			------------------ -------------
				pkg name 	Driver-classname


Driver url :		jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE
			-----------------  |         |   |
			sub protocol 	hostname portno  logical_database_name


Database username : 	system

Database password : 	admin 



Interview Question
====================


Jagged Array
=============
Jagged array is also known as array of arrays.

It's a multidimensional array where each row can have a different length.

Diagram: jdbc1.7

ex:


import java.util.Scanner;
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

		int[][] arr=new int[3][];

		arr[0]=new int[3];
		arr[1]=new int[4];
		arr[2]=new int[2];

		for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
		{
			for(int j=0;j<arr[i].length;j++)
			{
				System.out.println("Enter the element of arr["+i+"]["+j+"] :");
				arr[i][j]=sc.nextInt();
			}	
		}

		//reading 
		for(int[] a:arr)
		{
			for(int i:a)
			{
				System.out.print(i+" ");
			}
			//new line
			System.out.println();
		}
	}
}
