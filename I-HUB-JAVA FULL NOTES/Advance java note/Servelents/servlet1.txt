Web Application
================
A web application is a collection of web resource programs having the capability to generate web pages.

We have two types of web pages.

1) Static web pages / Passive web pages
-------------------------------------
	A web page with fixed content is called static web page.
	ex:
		facebook login page
		Home page 
		Aboutus page
		contactus page 
		services page 
		and etc.

2) Dynamic web pages / Active web pages 
---------------------------------------
	A web page with no fixed content is called dynamic web page.
	ex:
		live cricket score page
		stock market share value page 
		gmail inbox page 
		and etc.

We have two types of web resource programs.

1) Static web resource programs
-------------------------------
	A web resource program which is used to generate static web pages.
	ex:
		HTML program
		CSS program
		Bootstrap program
		Angularjs program
		Reactjs program
		and etc.

2) Dynamic web resource programs 
-------------------------------
	A web resource program which is used to generate dynamic web pages.
	ex:
		Servlet program
		JSP program 
		and etc.

Based on the position and execution above web resource programs are divided into two types.

1) Client side web resource programs
------------------------------------
	A web resource program which executes at client side (Browser window) is called client side
	web resource program.
	ex:
		HTML program
		CSS program
		JavaScript program
		Bootstrap program 
		and etc.

2) Server side web resource programs
-------------------------------------
	A web resource program which executes at server side is called server side web resource
 	program.
	ex:
		servlet program 
		jsp program 
		and etc.


Web Application and Web Resource program Execution
===================================================
Java application executes manually.

Web application and web resource program execute at the time when they have requested.

Diagram: servlet1.1

With respect to the diagram : 

1) Enduser gives the request to web resource program.

2) Web Server will trap that request and it passes that request to appropriate web resource program.

3) Web resource program executes the logic to process the request.

4) Web resource program communicates with database software if necessary.

5) Web resource program gives output to web server.

6) Web server sends the output to browser window as dynamic response.


Web Server 
==========
A web server is a piece of software which is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.

ex:
	Tomcat, Resin, Web Logic, JBoss, GlassFish and etc.


Responsibilities of web server 
------------------------------
> It takes continues request from client.

> It traps the request and passes that request to appropriate web resource program.

> It provides environment to deploy and undeploy the web applications.

> It will add middleware services only to deployed web applications.

> It provides environment to execute all client side web resource programs at browser window.

> It takes the output from web resource program and send to browser window as dynamic response.

> It is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.

To execute java program we required JRE/JVM.

To execute servlet program  we required servlet container.

To execute JSP program we required jsp container.



Web Container
=============
Web container is a software application or a program which is used to manage whole life cycle of web resource program i.e from birth to death.

Servlet container manage whole life cycle of servlet program.

JSP container manage whoe life cycle of jsp program.

Some part of industry consider servlet container and JSP container are web containers.

Every server contains servlet container and JSP container. So we don't need to arrange it seperately.


Tomcat 
=======

Version			:	9.x 

Vendor			:	Apache Software Foundation 

Website			: 	www.tomcat.apache.org

Creator			:	James Duncan Davidson

Port No			:	8080  (2525)	

Servlet container 	:	Catalina 

JSP container		:	Jasper 

Download link 		:

Tomcat is a not a container. It is a server which contains servlet container and jsp container.

Tomcat install will ask following things.

1) Http Connector port 

2) Adminstrator username : admin 
	       password : admin 

3) JDK location 

4) Tomcat Installation location 


Steps to install Tomcat server
=============================
Double click to Tomcat server software --> Yes --> Next --> I Agree --> select Full -->

Http Connector port : 8080 

Adminstrator username : admin
	     password : admin  ---> Next --> Next --> Install. 



Steps to set Tomcat server from Automatic to Manual Mode
========================================================
goto services --> select Apache Tomcat  --> click to stop (link) --> double click to Apache Tomcat --> startup type : manual ---> Apply and ok.



Servlet 
========
Servlet is a dynamic web resource program which is used to enhance the functionality of web server, proxy server or IDE's server.

or

Servlet is a java based dynamic web resource program which is used to generate dynamic web pages.

or

Servlet is a single instance multithread java based web resource program which is used to develop web applications.

Servlet API's
==============
API is a collection of packages.
ex:
	javax.servlet package
	javax.servlet.http package 


Important terminologies
========================
javax.servlet.Servlet(I)
	|
	|
javax.servlet.GenericServlet(AC)
	|
	|
javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet(C) 


Assignment
===========
Q) Write a jdbc application to create a student table?
